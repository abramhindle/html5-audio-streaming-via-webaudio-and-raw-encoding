This project is about streaming audio to the web with an attempt to keep the latency down.

This can be achieved by reducing encoding latency and using websockets or webrtc, but right now I'm trying the most basic thing, using XMLHTTPRequest for now. 

Currently it works on Firefox 25 and Chromium 28.

perl stream.pl daemon sine.raw

http://localhost:3000/stream.html

For jack (currently doesn't sound right)

MOJO_REACTOR=Mojo::Reactor::Poll perl jack-spammer.pl daemon

Bugs:

Currently the jack stuff is awful and skipping. We're reimplementing a streaming server so we have to keep state to ensure we're not losing anything. Oh well.

Also Jack is very precarious. 11600 was the wait for the dummy driver to get 2048.

Dependencies:

Mojolicious::Lite

Anecdotal Performance:

Less than 1 second localhost performance. This is better than darkice/icecast usually.
